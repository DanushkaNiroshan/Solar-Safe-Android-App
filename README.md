# ðŸŒ„Solar Safe Android App

The Solar Safe React Native App is designed to provide real-time monitoring of important metrics for lithium-ion battery systems used in solar installations. This includes voltage levels for three cells, current indication, temperature, and state of charge. The app is built using React Native and Expo, with Firebase integration for real-time data updates and synchronization.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: View real-time data for voltage levels, current, temperature, and state of charge.
- **Circular Progress Bars**: Visualize battery metrics using circular progress bars for easy interpretation.
- **Expo and React Native**: Built using Expo and React Native for cross-platform compatibility and ease of development.
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilize Firebase for seamless real-time data synchronization and updates.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The app is designed with a user-friendly interface for intuitive navigation and usage.

## Usage
